# ST2195-Coursework
Choose any subset of (at least two) consecutive years and any of the supplementary information provided by the Harvard Dataverse to answer the following questions using the principles and tools you have learned in this course:

1. When is the best time of day, day of the week, and time of year to fly to minimise delays?
2. Do older planes suffer more delays? 
3. How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time? 
4. Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others? 
5. Use the available variables to construct a model that predicts delays.

All questions should be answered using R and Python for all tasks.
